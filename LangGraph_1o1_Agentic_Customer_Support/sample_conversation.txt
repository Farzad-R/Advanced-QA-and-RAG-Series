Hi there, what time is my flight?
Am I allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.
Update my flight to sometime next week then
The next available option is great
what about lodging and transportation?
Yeah i think i'd like an affordable hotel for my week-long stay (7 days). And I'll want to rent a car.
OK could you place a reservation for your recommended hotel? It sounds nice.
yes go ahead and book anything that's moderate expense and has availability.
Now for a car, what are my options?",
Awesome let's just get the cheapest option. Go ahead and book for 7 days
Cool so now what recommendations do you have on excursions?
Are they available while I'm there?
